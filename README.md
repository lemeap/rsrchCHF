# Ph.D. research topics: development of new correlation for Critical Heat Flux (CHF)

# 1. Purpose
- Development of new correlation for predicting Critical Heat Flux (CHF) based on the "Local Condition Hypothesis" in flow boiling channel including non-circular and refrigerants
- Solving the complex partial differential equation varying the initial and boundary conditions according to phenomenological consideration given operating conditions

# 2. Structure of programm
## 1) Calculation of the thermodynamic physical properties
## 2) Calculation of the related parameters such as dimensionless numbers, damping factor, statistical parameter for hedging bias of data
## 3) Numerical algorithm for solving the complex partical difeerential equation (called as "Rate equation based on the heat balance") in terms of the inlet fluid condition in flow boiling channel
## 4)
